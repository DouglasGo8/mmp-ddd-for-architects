. Strategic Pattern
.. Divide a complex & large business problem into smaller chunks with well defined boundaries

.Sub-domain Complexity
.. Each sub-domain has a different level of complexity

. Sub-domains are specific to the Enterprise
.. There are three types of Domains, *_Generic|Core|Supporting_*

.Sub-domain granularity
.. Retail Accounts _[Saving Account, Checking Accounts, Certificate of Deposit, Ledger & Accounting, Retail Banking Compliance]_

== Bounded Contexts

. Represents in a common domain model a intended used across the enterprise, e.g a Customer needs interact with Retail Banking, Loans etc, a Customer Management can be classified as Bounded Context
. Bounded Contexts can group Retail Banking, Customer Management, Credit Cards etc
. Each BC represents its OWN domain model
. There's no an exact process to discovery BCs
. For imaginary travel company we can have Areas/BC such as _Marketing, Product Management, Sales, Support etc_
